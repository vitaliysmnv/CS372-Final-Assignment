# CS372-Final Assignment
 Newwork Management Service Software & Monitoring Service Software 
## Description
This project is designed to develop a distributed network monitoring system, focusing on the intricate dynamics of managing persistent TCP connections, configuration management, and real-time data exchange between a central management service and multiple monitoring services. Through this project, participants will explore advanced concepts such as TCP keepalive for connection stability. This hands-on experience aims to deepen understanding of distributed systems, network programming, and the practical challenges of maintaining a resilient and responsive monitoring infrastructure in real-world scenarios.
